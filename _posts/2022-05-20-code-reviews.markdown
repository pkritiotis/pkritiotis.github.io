Pull requests are a vital step in the developer workflow and we should ensure that we have a solid process to efficiently and effectively manage them.

Check Frequency
When developers open a PR, they are blocked from finishing their task until their code is reviewed.

When a specific task is blocked no one can work on tasks that depend on the task remaining in review
The developer might need to work on multiple different tasks which requires a lot of context-switching that is inefficient. Working on two parallel items is fine, but if something stays stale for long it can become difficult to get back and gain the full context to work on it again.
It's important that the reviewers provide feeback

All PR requests should be checked by the reviewers within 24 hours
