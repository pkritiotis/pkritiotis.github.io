This article describes a Technical Requirement Analysis approach that includes a set of steps that help in clarifying ambiguity and prevent unplanned issues before an engineering team jumps into the design phase. 

# Introduction
There is a great amount of literature on approaching different Software Development LifeCycle (SDLCs) frameworks that provide the steps, practices  and guidelines required to achieve an efficient software development process.
For most of the time, software engineers are involved in this whole process after the business requirements phase with the responsibility to design, implement, test and deploy applications.

Between the handover of the requirements from the product team to the engineering team and the initiation of the design there is a short period in which engineers work with the product team to clarify any ambiguous requirements, talk about acceptance criteria and agree on specific business specs. 

This phase which in this article I refer to as **Technical Requirement Analysis**, is one of the most important phases in the lifecycle. In the following sections, we will explore why this phase is important in detail and provide a set of well-defined, structured steps to minimize unclarity and future inconvenience.


# Importance
The Technical Analysis of Requirements phase is important for many reasons:
1. It **ensures that engineering and product are aligned** on the goal and the problem this feature is trying to solve. While the product team has gathers the requirements from the stakeholders and are aligned with business, it is also important that the defined requirements are well understood by the engineering too. This will ensure that the end-goal is the same from all teams' perspectives. 
2. It **allows engineers to raise concerns and present possible issues** on the requirements. Firstly, some features can be technically infeasible. This is usually prevented by having some technical presence when the product defines the business requirements. However, even for feasible issues, the technical team might raise risks and present technical challenges that are not trivial to catch at the requirement gathering phase.
3. It **allows engineers to give their input and perhaps reshape the requirements**. While the product/business team see the requirements from a customer perspective, engineers can identify collateral technical consequences, future codebase quality issues that should be considered. Depending on the priorities and the long term vision, this input from engineers might change the course of the feature and alter some of the requirements. A small tweak that is not so important for the product can decrease the complexity and consequently the delivery time of the feature.

# A simple, solid Technical Requirement Analysis approach
In my experience working on new features, I have not seen a standard way to approach this phase. However, through the years I have personally used a few tools and I have been incrementally optimizing my approach on this. In this sesction I will be sharing this approach.

Please note that this is by no means a phase that has to be strictly defined and may not be applicable for all use-cases, but I believe some of the steps can be useful.

## 1. Read the docs!
Quite obvious uh? Well, yes it is :) 

The technical requirement analysis is ideally a *team activity*. The engineering team should dedicate enough time to read the requirements and make sure that all members understand **what** is the problem, **why** it needs to be addressed, and how the **how** the feature requirements addresses it.

If there are any unknowns or any missing context, this is the time to ask questions to the product and seek complete understanding on the requirements.

Reading and clarifying requirements expands the domain knowledge of engineers and also makes the engineers feel more engaged.

## 2. Edge-Case Analysis - Business Specifications
Once the requirements are well understood, the team should proceed to the in-depth edge-case analysis stage.

Often, the requirements presented from the Product cover the essentials, but the engineering perspective can bring edge cases that are related to the system behavior and impact on other services that product might be unaware off. 

The purpose of this step is to raise these edge cases, and if it's possible present available options to manage them and even propose a recommended way forward.

### a. Identify Edge Cases
The team should look at the requirements with the engineering lens and understand if there are any edge cases missed by the product in the requirements. 

Example: We may have a requirement from the product to 'send an email to a user when their account balance changes'. The engineering can bring the edge case of 'What happens when the email provider is not available at the time of the change?'

### b. Present Edge Case Options
Once the edge cases are identified, for the ones that the engineering team can have an opinion, the team could prepare a list of options with pros and cons.
Please note that, even though these options are presented by the engineering team, since we are talking about business requirements, the final decision should be made by the product.

Example: From the previous example 'Send an email to a user when their account balance changes. What happens when the email provider is not available' the options could be:
- Option 1: Don't send an email
	- Pros:
		- Technically Easy
	- Cons:
		- The customer might be unhappy
		- If this is a marketing promotional email it may be ok. But if this is a financial status related email it wouldn't be acceptable.
- Option 2: Send the email when the provider is available
	- Pros:
		- Customer is happy. Will eventually receive the email
	- Cons:
		- Technically complicated. Requires retrial policy management that is currently not available
	- Follow-up questions:
		- How quickly should we retry? Do we have a maximum time-window for retrials?
		- Does our provider's SLAs meet our requirements?
- Option 3: Fallback to SMS
	- Pros:
		- Good customer experience.
	- Cons:
		- This might fail too
		- The customer might not have a mobile number

### c. Edge case resolution - Recommended Approach

If the requirement is purely technical, and the technical complexity between solutions vary with impact on delivery timelines, introduced tech debt, troubleshooting convenience etc, then the engineering team can propose a recommended approach. This will help drive the edge case resolution in a quicker manner if the product agrees.

However, this sub-step is not mandatory.

## 3. Finalize revised Business Specs 
Once the requirement clarifications are given with all edge cases documented with possible options and maybe the recommended approach, the product team can review the new information.
In this phase the product team must understand the edge cases, the concerns from the engineering side, and based on that take an informed decisions taking into account the pros and cons of the selected approach on how to move forward.

## 4. Data Flow Analysis
Having the requirements well-defined with all edge cases the engineering team can proceed with the technical data flow analysis. This stage is often grouped under the technical design stage but I find that doing this at a high level earlier in the process, offers great initial feedback on the data requirements of the requested feature.

In this stage I like to think in terms of input and output. All features require an input and produce an output and this can be the base of this phase.

Based on the input requirements, the team needs to identify
a. If the input is already available
	- For example will the input provided by the client or already exists within an internal component
b. If it is not available, determine where the information is
	- For example, if the input required is missing, determine which external sources are the owners of the data we are looking for.

The output should reflect the requirements as well. If the output is a data object, then an initial version of the schema can be defined in this stage. This is particularly useful when working on features for which the output is a bloker to another feature implemented by an external team. 

Since this is still the analysis stage, 

## 5. Extract Use Cases
The next step is to identify the use cases.
We can think of use cases as individual operations that should be served by the application to meet the requirements.
A useful tool we can use in this phase is thinking of use-cases in terms of **Commands** and **Queries**. If a requirement refers to an operation that provides data it can be though of as a 'Query'. If the operation modifies data, it can be considered as a 'Command'.
This separation of use-cases is particularly useful when working with code bases using [Clean Architecture]().

At the end of this step, the engineering team should have a clear picture of the requirements in very high detail and they can start visualizing how the technical design would look like.
# TL;DR;

## 1. Read the docs!
### Action:
Understand:
- What is the problem we are solving?
- Why do we need to solve it?
- How does this feature solve the issue?
### Expected outcome
Requirements are clarified

## 2. Edge-Case analysis
### Actions:
- Identify edge-cases
- Present options
- Propose Recommended Approach

## 3. Finalize revises business specs
- Revised business specs with BDD user stories and acceptance criteria

## 4. Data Flow Analysis
- Identify required data.
- Find input data
- Initial design of output data

## 5. Use CasÎµ
- Extract use cases

# Conclusion
That's it. This is the structured approach that I have been following during the last years and I have seen it producing great results in terms of common expectations/alignment between product and engineering, and preventing delayed capturing of edge cases.

This is a process, and naturally some of its steps might be applicable in one context but not in another. I find structure in this phase very beneficial as it gives a sense of progress and also a set of objectives to look for before proceeding with the design.
