## My philosophy on working with legacy code

### Respect the predecessors decisions
I have worked with a number of legacy projects and I have had thought of the type **"Why on earth did they do this like X? They could have easily done it like Y instead"**. 

Well, software code is organic. And business often prioritize time-to-market over future extensibility and maintainability. We also learn from our mistakes. All these factors contribute to instances in which we initially design optimal code for Feature A and Feature B in mind. And when Feature C comes and the code is not ready for it we produce quick results by bypassing quality standards. Been there, done that.

My philosophy around legacy code is:
1. Never rush to judge/blame previous code authors. 
2. The state of the software you inherit does not represent the competency of its developers.


### Consistency
No matter how bad you think the design or style or any other attribute of the codebase approach is, it is much better in the long-term to conform to it when modifying or introducing new behavior. This comes back to readability and maintainability.
