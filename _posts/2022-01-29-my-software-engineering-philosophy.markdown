This post contains my *software engineering philosophy*; a list of the fundamental *values* that I have accumulated over the years and that I use to decide how to work on software engineering problems.

## Introduction
Over the years I have read, discussed and studied multiple ways of approaching software engineering projects and experimented with different techniques and suggestions.

While there are some core best practices for which there is a general consensus within the software engineering community, each engineer has a different experience and therefore different views from others.

Through our experience we reflect on good and bad results from which we form an opinion and principles/*values* that shape the way we work. This set of principles compose the term *"software philosophy"*.

In the next sections I will be sharing view on the importance of having a software philosophy and the framework with the values around how I approach software egnineering projects.

### The philosophy in Software Engineering

## The philosophy analogy
I am an admirer of philosophy with a strong interest in *ethics* and especially practical ethics.

What I admire most about the philosophy of ethics, is that through the study of different concepts on how one should live an *ethical* life as per their own terms, we can form **fundamental values** that are used as a guide in our decision making. 

These fundamental values can significantly increase the quality of life by making it simpler. When these values are engraved through one's character and become their identity, decision making becomes much more straightforward in complicated cases we might be exposed to.

Without the guidance of fundamental values that are previously well-established, it can become very difficult to make *"correct"*, as per our own terms,  decisions.

This is why self-reflection and the study of important philosophy concepts is such a useful tool for an in-control and happy life.
