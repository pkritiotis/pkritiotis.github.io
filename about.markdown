Hey 👋, I’m Panayiotis Kritiotis.

I’m a **Senior Engineering Manager** at efood, with over a decade of experience in the tech world. My work combines a hands-on love for solving technical challenges with a passion for engineering leadership.

I specialize in architecting and building **large-scale, distributed web services** and have a particular passion for **Go**.

You’ll often hear me talking about Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and frameworks (*“Frameworks, frameworks everywhere!”*)—topics that fascinate me for how they guide decision-making, whether it’s about building scalable systems or fostering effective teamwork.

I’m especially drawn to the **core principles of software engineering**—from shaping **high-performing teams** to designing **robust architectures** and **refining software design**.

Outside of work, you’ll often find me rock climbing, running, or getting lost in a good book.
