Hey ðŸ‘‹ , Iâ€™m Panayiotis Kritiotis.

I work as a **Senior Engineering Manager** at [Delivery Hero(efood)](https://efood.gr).

I've spent over a decade in the tech industry, where my love for deep technical challenges and hands-on approach meets my enthusiasm for leadership. I have extensive **experience in building large-scale, distributed web services**.

Iâ€™m passionate about understanding the core of software engineering - delving into **high-performing teams, architecture, and software design** and enjoy working with **Go**.

In my free time, you will find me rock climbing, running, and reading books.
