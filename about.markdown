I'm **Panayiotis Kritiotis**.

I work as an **Engineering Manager** @ **[Linearity](https://www.vectornator.io/)**.

I am interested in building **high-performance software engineering teams and large-scale, distributed web applications**.

I am fascinated by **software team organization and productivity**, **software design patterns**, **architecture design**, and the human factors in **software engineering**.

I enjoy working with **Go**.

In my free time, you will find me **rock climbing**, **running**, and **reading books**.
