I'm **Panayiotis Kritiotis**.

I work as an **Engineering Manager/Technical Lead** @ **[Beat](https://thebeat.co/)**.

During my work day, I build **high-performance, large-scale, distributed web applications**.

I am fascinated by **software design patterns**, **clean code**, **architecture design**, and the human factors in **software engineering**.

I enjoy working with **C#** and **Go**.

In my free time, you will find me **rock climbing**, **running**, and **reading books**.
